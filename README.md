# Action Language for EMF official documentation

This repository holds the website of the [Action Language for EMF (ALE)](https://github.com/gemoc/ale-lang).

The website is mainly written in Markdown and is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## Contributing

This repository has 2 main branches:

 - `master`: the development branch, contains website's sources
 - `gh-branches`: the publishing branch, contains the HTML files generated by Hugo

Changes to the content of the site should first be merged in the `master` branch.

Once changes are meaningful, they should be published online by:
1. Generating the site with `hugo`
2. Committing and pushing the content of the `public/` folder

Running the `publish_to_ghpages.sh` script ensures that the site is properly generated. It does not actually publishes the site: it is up to the developer to write a meaningful commit message and to push the changes.

## Prerequisites

You need [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) (likely at least version 0.60.0).

## Running the website locally

Run `hugo serve` then open `http://localhost:1313/ale-lang-docs/`.
