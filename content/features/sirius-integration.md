## Behavior layer

ALE provides a Sirius layer called *Behavior* that enhances Sirius representations with attributes and methods defined in ALE source files.

To activate this layer:
1. Right-click on the representation file (*.aird*) and select `Viewpoints Selection`
2. Check `Behavior` then validate

It can now be shown from the toolbar of the diagram representation:

When the Behavior layer is activated the palette is enhanced with new tools:

Use these tools to add runtime elements directly from the Sirius representation.
